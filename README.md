note to self: remove twitter keys from the file

1. twitter streaming [x]
2. jam into db [x] - queue system found to be unnecessary, on occasion a few tweets will be skipped to catch up
3. check duplicates [x]
4. sentiment analaysis [WIP]
5. associate characteristics using neural networks to tweets + users
6. spit out data
7. create nice UI (HTML?) to present data or something like that
8. other stuff im compeltely forgetting
