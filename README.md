To use: insert correct Twitter keys into the `config.ini` file (no quotation marks around keys necessary), then run `twitter.py` or `main.py`, which is a WIP main menu.

Requires Python 3.x, tested on 3.5/3.6.

--currently working on a CLI menu interface for simplicity--

1. twitter streaming [x]  - queue system found to be unnecessary, on occasion a few tweets will be skipped to catch up
2. Put in a DB (MongoDB) [x] - to be improved as i learn how databases work.
3. check duplicates [x] - basic version done. Eliminates all punctuation and spaces from tweets being compared. 
4. sentiment analaysis [WIP] - will start this soon.
5. associate characteristics using neural networks to tweets + users
6. spit out data
7. create nice UI (HTML?) to present data or something like that
